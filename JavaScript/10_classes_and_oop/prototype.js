// ðŸ”¹ Easy Explanation of JavaScript's [[Prototype]]
// Every object in JavaScript has a hidden link to another object. This link is called [[Prototype]] (or __proto__).
// When you try to use a property or method on an object, JavaScript first looks inside that object.
// If it doesn't find it there, it starts looking in the prototype â€” the object it's linked to.
// It keeps going up the chain of prototypes until it finds the property or reaches the end (null).
